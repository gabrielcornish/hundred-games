The King slurps down his blue slushee and burps. Then he yells at me.

* [Ugh...]

- "Yo! Listen!" the king's voice is high pitched, "I need you to go and rescue the princess, okay, 'kay? Now go!"
//CHOICE ONE
* (denied) ["Nah, I'm good. Thanks."] I doubt the king is used to hearing no. This should go over well.
    "You dare defy the greatest king who ever existed! OUTRAGOUS!!! I could have your head!" 
    
    //CHOICE TWO
    ** I stare back blankly. 
       I'm so sick and tired of this guys crap all the time.
        -> defied
    ** (hearty_laugh) [I laugh in his face.] I burst out into a hearty laugh, "BAHAHAHAHAHA" 
    -> defied
    
    ** (bird_flipped) I flip him the bird. 
    -> defied
    
* "Again?"
    "What of it!?" He screams as some slurpee spits onto my face. Yuck. 
    "She needs rescuing, what difference does it make when and how often? Just go and do your job!"
    
    // CHOICE THREE
    ** (rude_outburst) ["Why so rude? Ask nicely. Geez!"] I probably shouldn't have said that.
        "Don't you dare speak to me like that!" The king looks towards his two guards, "Can you believe the nerve of this squire? One more outburst like that and I'll have your head. Understood?"
        
        //CHOICE FOUR
        *** "Whatever..."
        The king doesn't look happy with my response, but it doesn't look like he's going to do anything. 
        -> defied
        
        *** "I'm terribly sorry, your majesty."
        The king sits back. He looks pleased with my response, "So I'll assume you'll agree to go and rescue the princess?"
            
            //CHOICE FIVE
            **** (hesitant) "I mean, if I have to. I guess." 
            -> agreed
            **** "It will be my honor!" 
            -> agreed
            **** "You assumed wrong. I'm not going to save her[."]," I calmly respond. 
            -> defied
        
        *** "You know what? I don't have to take any more of your crap. I'm outie." 
        -> defied
        
    ** (knows_princess_location) "Where is she being held captive?"
        "Cool your jets!" The king yells, "I was just getting to that! The princess is at the Dragon's Tower. The Dreaded Dragon is holding her for ransom. Pshh, like I'm gonna pay that greedy lizard. That's why you're going to go get her."
        
        *** "Oh! So you're like a cheap king?" 
        -> rude_outburst
        
        *** "Of course, your majesty."
        -> count_on_me
    
    ** "What's in it for me?"
        The king looks shocked by this question, "What's in it for you? Uh, how about you get to be on my good side and I don't chop of your head. Sound good?"
        
        //CHOICE EIGHT
        *** "Fine. I'll rescue your princess." 
        -> agreed
        
        *** "No. It doesn't 'sound good'[."]," I respond coldly.
        -> denied
        
    ** Stay silent[.]. The king grows impatient, "Oh, what!? Now you don't have anything to say? You were so chatty a second ago."  
    -> defied
    
* (count_on_me) ["You can count on me, my lord."]
    "Ah! I love me and obedient lap dog," the king smiles with blue colored teeth, "yes I do."
    
    //CHOICE SIX
    
    ** "Hey! I'm nobody's lap dog. Got it?" 
        -> rude_outburst
        
    ** (changed_mind) "You know what? I've changed my mind[."]," I respond with a cold look, "I'm not going to rescue your princess." 
        -> defied
        
    ** (lap_dog) "Very good, sir." 
        -> agreed

- -> END

The king leans forward in his chair. His patience is running thin, "{bird_flipped:I'm going to ignore your middle finger, because I'm a merciful king.} {hearty_laugh: Think it's funny do yeah?} I'll give you one more chance to {(denied or changed_mind):reconsider|comply}. Rescue the princess or suffer the consequences. Okay, 'kay?"

// CHOICE SEVEN
* (whatever) "Sure. Fine. Whatever[."]," I respond, rolling my eyes. 
-> agreed

* (suck_eggs) "Suck eggs, dude[."]," I spit back at him. 
   Oh man that felt good to say! However it was unwise. 
   
   Before I know it, two massive guards grab me by the arms and slam a black bag over my head. My vision goes black. I can feel them haul me away, but I don't know to where. 
   The last thing I hear is the king sucking down the remainder of his slurpee. 
   
   ** [Welp, this can't be good.] -> Thrown_In_Jail

- -> END

= agreed
"{hesitant or whatever:You know, you should be more grateful for the opportunity. None-the-less, I'm happy you've accepted my offer.|Excellent!}{rude_outburst or denied: I'll excuse your rude outburst from earlier.}{bird_flipped: However, if you ever flick me off again, I'll chop off that finger for good. Understood?}" 

The king now looks pleased. He sucks down the remainder of his slurpee and chucks the bottle at his servant. "Off you go then!" 

The servant picks up after the kings trash then proceeds to show you out of the castle.

//CHOICE NINE
* (knows_servant) [I thank the servant] "Thank you for escorting me out," I say appreciatevly.
    Once out of ear shot of the king, the servant whispers through gritted teeth, "Whatever you do, do not save the princess."
    
        ** "What!? Why?"
            Suddenly the servant sees a guard approaching and quickly flashes a massive smile, "Thank you for visiting the king! Buh bye now! Safe travels!"
            
        ** "Watch your tone, servant. I'll report you to the king."
            The servant's face turns to one of horror, "My apologies. Just a bit of bad humor. Long live the king. Safe travels now." The servant leaves you at the castle entrance and returns.

* I remain silent.
    The servant walks me just past the castle entrance and then returns back inside.
