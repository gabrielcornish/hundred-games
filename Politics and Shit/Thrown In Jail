== Thrown_In_Jail ==
I finally regain my sight. Seems like I'm in a prison cell in a stinky, dank dungeon with sweaty stone walls. It also looks like I'm sharing a cell with a beautiful woman in an expensive white wedding dress. 

* [She looks like a million bucks, tax-free.]
* [I'm not interested in married woman.]

- She's rests on a straw bed in the corner while she stares up at the ceiling. She has a look of half patience and half boredom.

* [I eye her curiously.]
* [I pretend like she's not there.]

- "Watchya in for?" she asks barely looking in my direction.

* {encounter_one.defied.suck_eggs} "I told the king to suck eggs[."]," I reply with a proud smirk.
    "Impressive. You must be either very brave or you have a death wish. It's a shame we won't get to know each other more," the bride says with an amused look.
    
* (rather_not) "I'd rather not say[..."]," I respond politely. I'm not the one to give up information to strangers.
    "Fair enough," she responds coldly, <> -> silent
    
* "What are YOU in for[?"]?" I counter.
    "Nothing," she responds.
    "Nothing?"
    "{encounter_one: Knowing the king, does that surprise you?|Yup.}" The bride pulls out some ear buds from inside her wedding dress and plugs them into her ears. She's cleary bored of this conversation.
    
    ** "That can't be the whole story[."]," I reply, my curiousity peaked.
        "You're right," she says with a smirk. She pulls out one of her ear buds and props herself up on an elbow, "I actually got myself locked up on purpose."
        "Why would you do that?"
        "Isn't it obvious? To avoid getting married. Duh!" She rolls back over to stare at the ceiling.
        
    ** I ignore her and try to look for a way out of this mess.[] There's a guard patroling the front of the cell, but no visible way to escape this prsion.
        "You're not going to find a way out," the bride says calmly staring up at the ceiling, "but sit tight. I'll get you out of here."
* (silent)[I stay silent.]
    "{not rather_not:Silent type? }No problem. I get it. I respect it." The bride lets out a bored sigh and then rolls over in her straw bed, "I'd cover my ears if I were you."
    She puts her fingers to her ears.

- I cock my head, puzzled...

* [All of a sudden...]

- BANG!!!!
Out of no where a large explosion blasts through the moist stone wall behind me.

* [I try to take cover.] I distance myself from the direction of the blast, but there's nothing in the cell to hide behind.
* "Help!"[] I yell. The echo of my cry sounds a bit wimpier than I'd had hoped.

- My ears are ringing. Smoke, dust and rubble cloud my vision. I can't stop caughing.

* [I regain my composure.]

- When I finally open my water-filled eyes, there's a huge hole in the prison cell that leads out to a grassy field. The bride in the white dress is nowhere to be seen.

* ["Who was she!?"]
