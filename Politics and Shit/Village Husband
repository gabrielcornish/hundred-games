== Village_Husband_Encounter

As I walk through the village, a large man in a business suit approaches me. He looks worried.

"You seem like a sturdy adventurer, can you help out a desperate lover?" He looks like he's about to cry.

* "Sorry pal, I don't have time for you[."]," I reply brushing past him.
    "Oh, please adventurer! Just here me out," he says with a desperate look, "won't your kind heart help true love prevail?"
    
    ** "Nope[."]," I respond coldly.{encounter_one.agreed: I'm already on one too many quests as it is.}
        "I thought you were one of those honerable heroes. I guess I was wrong. Good day!" He spits at the ground near my feet. -> END
        
    ** "Fine, I'll hear you out."
    
* "How can I help?"
* {encounter_one.agreed} "Make it quick, I'm on official Kingdom Business."

- "My fiance," he pants, "she's locked away in a prison cell in the Moist Dungeon under the castle. They arrested her right before our wedding. Please if you can find a way to reunite us, I would be ever so grateful. I'll reward you hansomly. I'm a very very very very rich man, I assure you." -> village_husband_choice

* (accepted) "I'll see what I can do[."]," I say confidently.
    "Oh thank you, kind adventurer!" He looks plump and giddy, "I eagerly await your return with my wife to be rescued!"
    
* "If she's in prison, it's probably for a good reason[."]," I say bluntly.
    "Uh, well...I'm sure there are reasons. I can't say whether or not they're good." -> village_husband_choice
    
* "You want me to break her out of prison[?"]?" I ask cautiously.
    "In so many words...yeah, kinda. What do you say?" -> village_husband_choice
    
* (denied) "I don't have the time. Sorry. Good luck."
    The large business man just shakes his head and walks away dissapointed.

- -> END
