I step out on to a grassy field. Hills line the distance as a path unfolds in front of me. It splits into two directions. To the West a large Stone Tower looms in the distance. To the East a small village peaks out behind the green hills. 

{Thrown_In_Jail: All the guards in the castle are going to be wondering what just happened. I should put as much distance between myself and this place as possible.}

Where do I go next?

* [I head West to the large Stone Tower.]
* [I head East towars the Small Village.] -> entering_the_village
