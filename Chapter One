-> CHAPTER_ONE

== CHAPTER_ONE ==
* "Let's talk about this..."[] I say.
* "You're making a mistake[."]," I say.
* "Is this necessary?" [] I ask.

- Nancy the Orc grabs me by the throat, lifts me off my feet and throws me out the tavern window.

* Ouch!

- I land hard on the main street of the village, with the sun beaming down on me. "Damn, she's strong," I mutter to myself. I groan and roll onto my back.

* (stare) I stare up at the sky.
    Nice! It's actually a beautiful day out. The sun and clouds are out, plus there's nothing but blue skies. If it wasn't for this angry Orc, I wouldn't mind just laying here.
    
* "Help!!!"[] I yell desperately.
    The village is packed with people, but they don't give me any attention. 
    In fact they're stepping over my body to get to wherever they're going. Ugh, I swear every kingdom is the same.
    
* (knows_glass) I get up and dust myself off.
    Besides the broken glass down my shirt and in my pocket, I'd say I'm not doing too bad. I think I added a few scars to my collection, but you know what? 
    
    ** [I've looked worse.]
    
- Nancy the Orc storms out of the tavern and barrels toward me, her eyes narrowed.

* [I endeavor to reason with Nancy.]
    "Listen, Nancy. Sweetheart, I'm sure we can work this out peacefully-" 
    
    I don't get the words out. 
    
    Nancy {stare:lifts me off the ground and} delivers a punch to my chest that sends me flying into a fruit stand. While I'm down here:
    
    ** I take a bite of an apple[.] from the smashed fruit stand. Well, actually I try to bite an apple. The fruit vendor snatches it from my hand.
        "That'll be 3 coins!" He scolds.
        "Seriously!?"
        
    ** I cry a little on the inside.
    
* [I try to distract her.]
    "Look! A..uhh..something overthere!" Note to self. Work on my distraction skills. 
    
    The Orc doesn't fall for it. Instead she lifts me over her head and slams me into the dirt street.
    
* [I attempt to defend myself.]
    {stare: I quickly get up and |I} throw my fists up like a boxer ready to take the beating of a lifetime. 
    The good news is that when Nancy does punch me in the chest it only sends me flying like 6 feet or so. Not too bad, plus it looks cool.
    
    Sure it makes breathing a bit tough, but at least I don't lose any teeth this time.

- <> I'll be honest. This is not at all how I imagined today would go. 
Within seconds, Nancy is hovering me.
"Money! Now!" She yells at me. Her breath is surprisingly minty fresh. Most Orcs are filthy. Not Nancy. She flosses her fangs.

* "I'll get you your money soon. Promise[."]," I reply, "I'm just having a bit of cashflow issues. You know how it is, right?"
    "Yeah I know how it is," Nancy gives a sympathetic smile, "I also don't care."
    
* "Can I get a loan extension?"[] I ask desperately.
    "You mean like the last 3 extensions I gave you?" She responds coldly.
    ** "Yes! Exactly!"
    ** "Is this a trick questions? I feel like it's a trick question[."]," I say.
    -- She responds with a hard slap to my face.
    -- "I'll take that as a no on the extension then."
    
- Nancy's patience is growing thin.
- "If you're not going to pay your debt in cash," she says disappointed, "Then I'll have to take it from your limbs."

* "Wait! Let's stop and think here."
* (personal) "You're taking this too personally."

- "{personal:It's not personal.|Oh, but I have thought about it. Quite a bit actually.} It's just business. You know how it is," she taunts.

- Nancy reaches for my favorite arm and is about to yank it off...

* "Goodbye arm[."]," I squeek.
* (eyes_closed) I close my eyes
* I plead one last time.
    Nancy ignore me.
    
- All of a sudden a tornado of horses fly through the village.
{eyes_closed: I open my eyes.} Nancy and I look up to see a fleet of the King's Guards storming through on horse back towards the center of the village.
- One of the King's Guards yells at Nancy, "Unhand that peasant for a sec, ok!? We have an important announcement!"

* "Peasant!? Really? That's kind of rude[."]," I reply hurt, "I'm no peasant. I'll have you know I'm the greatest adventurer this kingdom-"
    "Silence, peasant! How dare you address a King's Guard," the guard looks angry, "Orc! Be sure to rip this peasant's limbs off after my announcement."
    "Gladly," Nancy replies.
    
* "Yay! I get to keep my arm. Thank God!"[] I rejoice.
    Nancy whispers out of the corner of her mouth, "For now, you lucky bastard."

- The entire village has gathered around the King's Guards.
- "Listen well," the head guard begins, "Princess Darcy has gone missing and the King is offering a large some to anyone who can shed light on her wherabouts!"

* Suddenly a lightbulb goes off in my head!
